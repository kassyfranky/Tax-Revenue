# **Tax Revenue**

## Project Overview

Tax revenue refers to the income that governments receive from taxation. It plays a crucial role in funding public services, infrastructure, and government operations. Tax revenue is generated from various sources such as income tax, sales tax, property tax, and corporate tax. Governments use tax revenue to finance public goods and services like education, healthcare, defense, and transportation. It's essential for maintaining a functioning society and supporting the needs of the population. Tax revenue analysis on Tableau allows for a visual representation of tax data, enabling better insights and decision-making. Tableau's interactive dashboards and visualizations can help in understanding tax trends, identifying areas of improvement, and optimizing tax collection strategies.
